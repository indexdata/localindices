This manual is written using markdown. The Makefile uses pandoc to publish it 
into a distributable format (PDF).

You need to have pandoc and pdflatex backend installed. On macOS, you can get those with macports:

port install pandoc texlive-latex-extra texlive-fonts-extra texlive-fonts-recomended

Another way is via http://pandoc.org/installing.html
to install "pandoc" and "BasicTeX".
