The complete harvester setup consists of two git modules:
* lui-solr -- configuration for Solr to hold harvested records.
* localindices -- the harvester software, including its control panel.

(The lui-solr module is in /pub/ but localindices is in
/private/. That doesn't make a great deal of sense, but it doesn't
matter much.)

There is also a lui-solr3 module, which can be ignored. It seems to
have been a misconceived attempt to fork the source so it can work
with Solr 3.

Tne lui-solr package contains its own WAR files for Solr, so there is
on need to install Solr separately.

The localindices code can run against several different backends. But
one of them (plain files) is mostly a proof-of-concept, not intended
for use in real life. Another (Zebra) is deprecated. So for almost all
purposes, Solr (as configured by lui-solr) will be used.

Compilation is managed by Maven, so should be possible without using
an IDE. Deployment is by copying the WAR file into Tomcat's live area:
we may add Maven rules to run under Jetty.

What I want to know:

	How to get a lui-solr flavoured Solr running, how to change
	the schema for an existing Solr database, how to plumb the
	harvester into it, what you need installed before you start,
	all that kind of thing. Basically, everything I need to know
	to run it all locally and start making changes.
