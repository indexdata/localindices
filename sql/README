This directory contains all the SQL fragments needed to create a
Harvester database, and to upgrade it through its various versions.
Note that this is a database describing the harvesting jobs only: the
actual harvested data goes into a Solr database which is configured in
the separate but related "lui-solr" package.

Due to erratic record-keeping in the early days of this project, the
exact purpose of some of these fragments is not known, has had to be
recovered by archaeology. Those fragments are all in the "obsolete"
directory, and the README therein explains what is known.
