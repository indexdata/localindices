This directory contains files that were at some point involved in
creating the Harvester's MySQL database schema, e.g patch files
not versioned along with harvester releases.
They are retained, for now, both for historical reasons
and to help us out if we need to do more archaeology. They are:

* db_patch
	Contains early patch files, all incorporated in schema 2.2+

* convert_to_unicode.sql
	Sets UTF8  for the entire DB and converts column to TEXT. Modern
    MySQL installations should be UTF-8 already but you never know.
	Today the columns are 'mediumtext' according to the latest
	dump, and there are settings for UTF8 in the dump.

* reset-storage-type.sql
	This was related to support request SUP-709, but is obsolete
	now.
