This directory contains files that were at some point involved in
creating the Harvester's MySQL database schema, but which are no
longer needed. They are retained, for now, both for historical reasons
and to help us out if we need to do more archaeology. They are:

add_encoding.sql -- Adds a column that localindices.sql already
	creates. We can conclude that this predates the version of
	localindices.sql that got saved.

db_patch -- Contains other patches which, like add_encoding.sql, seems
	to have been incorporated in localindices.sql.

convert_to_unicode.sql -- Sets columns to type TEXT and sets some UTF8
	properties. But today the columns are 'mediumtext' according to
	the latest dump, and there are settings for UTF8 in the
	dump. Verdict: Things have moved on since that script.

localindices_no_data.sql -- Roughly, a version of the original
	localindices.sql script that does not add an rows to the
	tables. But it also differs from the main script in several
	other ways, and it's not clear what its value is now.

reset-storage-type.sql -- This was related to support request SUP-709,
	but is obsolete now.

transformations.sql -- This was created by Dennis in 2011. No-one
	still at Index Data knows what it is.
