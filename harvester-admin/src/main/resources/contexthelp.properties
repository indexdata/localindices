# Context sensitive help texts
# The property key has three sections 
# 1) The area, like 'jobs' or 'transformations' or 'settings' (for instance taken from 
#    web app path)
# 2) The section of a page, like 'general information' or 'oai-pmh specific information',
#    probably taken from the application page itself
# 3) The label of the field to provide help for, like 'service provider', taken from the page
#
# When constructing a property name from a field label, use underscore for spaces and omit colons.

jobs.General_information.Id   =  Automatically assigned identifier for the job

jobs.General_information.Name =  Preferably a unique name for users to identify this Harvester \
                resource. In some cases the name may be proposed after filling \
                out protocol specific section of the configuration (e.g Index \
                Data Connectors, OAI-PMH).

jobs.General_information.Service_Provider = Free-text field used by support staff for \
                           recording administrative information.<br/> Not used by the harvester.

jobs.General_information.Content_Description = Free-text field used by support staff \
                              for recording administrative information. Not used by the harvester.

jobs.General_information.Technical_Notes =  Free-text field used by support staff for \
                           recording administrative information. Not used by the harvester.

jobs.General_information.Contact_Notes = Free-text field used by support staff for recording \
                        administrative information. Not used by the harvester.

jobs.General_information.Harvest_job_enabled = Check to run the Harvesting job as described by the \
                              time/interval selected in "Harvest schedule". Leaving this \
                              box unchecked will make the job inactive.

jobs.General_information.Harvest_schedule = Use these fields to define a recurring time/interval at \
                                            which the Harvester job should run. E.g \
                                            for weekly runs specify a day of the week on which the harvest \
                                            should be executed.

jobs.General_information.Transformation_Pipeline = Select the transformation required to match the input \
                              format delivered by the feed to the internal format used by the Harvester for \
                              data storage. See the Transformation Pipelines manual section for more details.

jobs.General_information.Use_lax_parsing_(if_possible) = When enabled, harvester will attempt to parse malformed XML \
                                           (missing closing tags, entities)

jobs.General_information.Encoding_override_(ISO-8859-1,_UTF-8,_...) = A feed can return invalid encoded responses, such as \
                               having an XML header with encoding set to UTF-8, but actually return ISO-8859-1 in \
                               the data. Setting this field to the actual encoding will force the Harvester to use \
                               the specified encoding.

jobs.General_information.Storage = Select the storage type and location for the harvested data. The Harvester \
                               has a storage abstraction layer to allow it to work with multiple potential \
                               record storage systems, but at present, only Solr/Lucene is supported. <br/><br/>Once \
                               the Storage has been selected, it is possible to view the indexed records by \
                               clicking the Stored records: click to view field.

jobs.General_information.Stored_records = Follow this link to view previously indexed records from the chosen Storage.

jobs.General_information.Cache_on_disk = If enabled, harvest data is kept in the filesystem cache and the job \
                               can be restarted from this cache without needing to go back to the server. 

jobs.General_information.Limit_record_number_to = Limit the harvest run to a specified number of records: \
                               useful for testing job settings and transformation pipelines.

jobs.General_information.Connection/read_timeout_(seconds) = Specify a non-default timeout value for obtaining and \
                               reading from the network connection (socket). Values under 1 minute are not \
                               recommended.

jobs.General_information.Log_level = Specify the logging level for the job with DEBUG being the most verbose. \
                               INFO is the recommended log level in most cases.

jobs.General_information.Notification_e-mail_address(es)_(separate_with_comma) = Specify comma separated list of e-mail addresses that \
                               should receive notification on job completion.

jobs.General_information.Extra_configuration_(JSON) = Specify additional advanced harvester configuration in the \
                               JSON format.

jobs.General_information.Send_notification_if_severity_at_least = specify job completion status with the least \
                               severity that will trigger the e-mail notification.
                               
jobs.OAI-PMH_specific_information.OAI_Repository_URL = "to do"
