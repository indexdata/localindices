# Context sensitive help texts
# The property key has three sections 
# 1) The area, like 'jobs' or 'transformations' or 'settings' (basically taken from 
#    web app path
# 2) The section of a page, like 'general information' or 'oai-pmh specific information',
#    taken from the application page itself
# 3) The label of the field to provide help for, like 'service provider', take from the page
#
# The section and the label are constructed with underscores for spaces, so the label
# "Service provider:" under "General Info" would become jobs.General_Info.Service_provider.
