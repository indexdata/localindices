<pz:metadata type="fulltext"> Index Data Introduces Connectors in the Cloud | Index Data Search   Software Open Content About us Contact     Home » Index Data Introduces Connectors in the Cloud January, 2013 Index Data has introduced a new service that breaks down the boundaries between library systems and online data sources. Do you have an information source that stubbornly refuses to let itself be integrated into your user portal? Are you frustrated by the lack of standardized APIs to the information sources that you desperately need to access? MasterKey Connect can help. Lynn Bailey, Index Data's CEO, explains: "A large amount of information is hidden in the so-called 'deep web' -- in massive silos that are only inconsistently reached by the major search engines, if at all. MasterKey Connect is intended to unlock this treasure trove, for developers, information architects, and ultimately for users." Sebastian Hammer, co-founder and president, elaborates: "In a perfect world, every information source would expose a clean API, to make it easy to build applications and mashups that pull together information and present it to users when and where they need it most. We know that the reality falls far short of this, and the result is poorly integrated services and higher costs. With our MasterKey Connect service, we are leveraging our rich set of tools and our background in standardization to offer a universal access point for almost any data source imaginable. Our API is easy to use, and, because it is based on industry standards, it is compatible with scores of existing applications and tools." The solution uses a variety of technologies to access 'back-end' information resources -- proprietary APIs, standard interfaces, and even 'screen-scraping'. Access to the service is offered using the SRU webservice API as well as the widely implemented ANSI Z39.50 protocol. Readily available, open source tools make client development for these interfaces straightforward, and many applications in the library domain already support the protocols. Index Data brings together over 18 years of experience in information retrieval and systems integration to offer this service to developers, service providers, and even individual libraries.

<pz:metadata type="fulltext"> Index Data’s Integrated Discovery Model | Index Data Search   Software Open Content About us Contact     Home » Index Data’s Integrated Discovery Model Submitted by sebastian on Mon, 2011/06/13 - 9:38pm We are often asked about where we stand on the discussion of central indexing versus broadcast metasearching. Our standard answer: "You probably need some of both" always calls for further explanation. Some time ago, I wrote this up for a potential business partner. If it sounds a little like a marketing spiel... guilty as charged. I hope the content will still seem interesting to some folks thinking about these issues. While our specific approach and technology may be ours alone, the technical issues described here are pretty universal. It is our thesis that a discovery platform which bases itself wholly on either broadcast metasearching or a centralized harvest-and-index model is inherently limited, as compared to one which seamlessly integrates both. It is our goal to provide a versatile platform, capable of handling very large indexes as well as dynamically searching remote content. Our MasterKey platform is an expression of this idea. At the core of our platform is Pazpar2, a highly optimized multi-protocol search engine, capable of searching large numbers of heterogeneous resources in parallel. It features a web services API, a data model-agnostic approach to incoming search results, and a cloud-friendly, dynamic configuration mechanism, designed to fit into a variety of application environments. Pazpar2 will search a number of resources concurrently, through multiple protocols, while normalizing and integrating results. Through its SRU/Z39.50 capability, Pazpar2 can access standards-compliant library catalogs, commercial database providers, etc. Through gateway technologies, it can access a range of other resources: Our SimpleServer provides a simple platform on which to implement gateways to proprietary APIs; our Connector Platform enables access to searchable resources through web-based user interfaces. Facets are constructed on the fly through analysis of incoming results. Through its integrated Solr client, Pazpar2 can access locally and remotely maintained indexes, taking direct advantage of the capabilities of the Solr search engine to produce high-quality ranked and faceted results with lightning-fast response times. While accessing a locally operated Solr instance, configured to support an application-specific data model in tandem with Pazpar2, the data normalization step is eliminated, conserving CPU cycles. Facets can be derived directly from the Solr system, eliminating the need to analyze individual records. All local results can be integrated and merged before presentation to the user, providing a highly responsive experience. Data can be freely distributed across Solr instances, allowing for scalability management options in addition to those offered by Solr itself. Through Pazpar2’s data normalization mechanism, support for remotely maintained Solr instances with arbitrary record models is available, provided that a normalization stylesheet for the data model is provided. This allows for a more sophisticated level of integration with the increasing number of Solr-based applications in the field, and increases the versatility of the platform. Combining these elements, the user of a hybrid local/remote discovery platform will experience excellent response times on local content, and will see remote results added to the display as soon as they become available (how this is accomplished is a user interface decision). In addition to the elements described above, the MasterKey platform includes a harvester to schedule and manage harvesting jobs for local indexing purposes (HTTP bulk file download and OAI-PMH supported at present) as well as a service-oriented architecture for managing searchable resources, users, and subscriptions in a hierarchical way designed to address consortial requirements. All components are modular, sharing a service-oriented architecture, and designed to fit into as many architectural and operational contexts as possible.

<pz:metadata type="fulltext"> pazpar2: New Features and Challenges | Index Data Search   Software Open Content About us Contact     Home » pazpar2: New Features and Challenges Submitted by dennis on Fri, 2012/03/30 - 6:44am It has been quiet on the pazpar2 front lately, but I will make amends with this blog post. Lately I have been working on a Harvester that would harvest into a Local Unified Index (LUI). The LUI has been implemented with Solr. This means we can implement Integrated Search, which is our name for doing both searching remote targets (meta-searching) and a Local Unified Index (LUI), aka Central Index. New Features With this we saw a need to move the faceting logic from our UI into the backend. The old UI would combine (anding) the user-entered search with the faceting value. A search for "beer" faceted with the subject "Brewing" would become "beer and su=Brewing". There are two problems with this. First, the ccl for su is probably setup to match incomplete subfield (6=1), but when faceting we are interested in an exact match using complete field (6=3). This can be fixed by introducing a new ccl term, su_exact, that defines this and use this for faceting. However, this does not solve the other problem. Since Solr supports native faceting and a special API to do so, we need to be able to distinguish between user searches and facet searches. This made us introduce a new parameter to the search command in 1.6.0: limit. This carries the facet search parameters, so we can support both intersection of multiple facets and union for multiple values of the same facet, though our UI does not support the latter. However, the limit parameters require that we have configured limitmaps. Quite similar to cclmap definitions (au, su) this configures pazar2 on how to do faceted search. However they are using the pazpar2 meta-data field names (author, subject), not ccl names. The limitmaps supports three formats: rpn: ccl: local: rpn: uses RPN syntax to define search attribute. limitmap_author could be "rpn: @attr 1=1003 @attr 6=3" (use field 1003, complete field). ccl: will enable you to point to an existing cclmap definition. if you already defined a cclmap_auexact, you can point to this definition by using "ccl: auexact". local: means that we are not capable of doing any search for this facet, so "just" do a record filter on the facet. Together with a rewrite of the search logic, there is now a way to do a facet filtering without redoing the search. Pazpar2 will now compare the previous search with the new search and if they match, pazpar2 will not do a new search when adding a limit on a field that has local: definition. It has been requested on the yaz list, and it is now possible! Previously you would have re-configured the target with a record filter but still pazpar2 would re-search. But we do want to re-search targets with native facet support. In order to actually request and get native facets, we need to define other mapping, facetmap_metadata-field. So in order to request and get Solr facets for author, we would configure a facetmap_author with a value "author_exact". Solr requires different fields for searching (tokenized) and faceting (non-tokenized, exact), so the author_exact should be configured as a string or keyword type and having the value from author copied into it. The Challenges The challenges arise when we want to use native facet that Solr provides, combined with targets that don't. The implementation of Z39.50 protocol in yaz has been extended to have both facet request and response; I am not aware of any server implementations that uses it. Facets count generated by pazpar2 is over a small sample of records, typically 100, whereas native facet from Solr counts is the total for the full result. This means that native facets will typically dominate the facets lists. So pazpar2 has a feature to approximate the facet count. It scales up based on the total hit count. So finding 8 subject "Brewing" in the 100 samples, but the total hit count is 1200, pazpar2 can be configured to approximate the facet count to 8/100 * 1200 = 96. Related to meta-searching without facet support, we have a similar challenge. Target will be filtered for hits, but they will show up with full hit counts. The extreme is of course when no records are found for a target, it will still show up, and when faceting on the target, end up with zero results. Ouch. We need to implement an approximation here as well. All in all this may lead us to extend results returned with approximation values of such things. Then it would be up to clients to decide what to use. I think what would be valuable to implement in pazpar2 is a combined record filtering and limit map search. We may not be able to do an exact facet filtering on a target, but we might be able to do a search that would filter some result out, but a bit too wide. Applying the filtering on the result would remove the unwanted results. This is still possible if using a record filter setting, but this is currently not possible with the limit parameter. Performance Challenges LUI (using Solr) is quite fast, but then unifying a huge number of databases into one also means it will get hammered by requests from pazpar2. An easy optimization is to use 100 records instead of 20 records 5 times. Pazpar2 does not support presentChunk size larger than 20 at the moment. A bigger optimization would be to implement logic in pazpar2 to implement a LUI procotol, which would mean we could do all targets in one request, knowing that it is multiple target and do the separation before ingesting into session. Actually pazpar2 / yaz still doesn't do the special treatment of facets search for Solr; since we are seeing quite good performance with faceted searches, we haven't seen the need to do so yet. It will also require a ZOOM API extension. Another performance boost could come from finishing up our threading of pazpar2. If you want to test out the LUI combined with some meta-searched targets, go to http://mk2.indexdata.com and log in as blogguest using the password pazpar2. I would love to get feedback on the outstanding challenges and what you think is most valuable to implement in pazpar2.

Very good and interesting Submitted by ssp (not verified) on Sat, 2012/04/28 - 1:47am. Very good and interesting news! So far I found myself doing faceting client-side, so I could have multiple facets and all. This sounds like it may open the way to doing things server-side again. (Now I'll just have to find to to test/figure that out). I really like the idea of extending the searches on the server when facets are used. However, for some fields which require heavy normalisation (e.g. language, media type), it is unclear to me how to achieve that as pazpar2 does not »know« the original term (e.g. language code) to search for after fields have been normalised. You touch the UI issues that arise with this approach. Have you seen how people react to the greater unclarity of the less reliable hit counts? (you should really get rid of that captcha, it's causing considerable grief on my end) reply Hit counts Submitted by sebastian on Tue, 2012/07/03 - 2:56pm. The latest Pazpar2 will try to do some basic scaling of facets based on the 'sample' received. You're right it's a bit of a usability issue. Many don't care, but some get very upset when the numbers don't match exactly. One solution we've played with (you can see it at http://mk2.indexdata.com/) is to simply not show numbers, but to use tag-cloud-esque font scaling to indicate relative weight. Simply listing the facets without associated hitcounts can work too. Ultimately, though, the idea is to leave these choices up to the UI designer as much as possible. reply     News Index Data Introduces Connectors in the Cloud Posted on 2013.01.09 Visit Index Data at ALA Midwinter in Seattle!

Submitted by sebastian on Mon, 2011/07/25 - 8:12am Most of the science of Information Retrieval centers around being able to find and rank the right set of documents in response to a given query. We spend much time arguing about technical details like ranking algorithms and the benefits of indexing versus broadcast searching. Every Information Professional I know both deifies and fears Google because they get it right most of the time -- enough so that many people tend to assume that whatever pops to the top of a Google search MUST be right, because it's right there, in the result screen. Producing that seemingly simple list of documents from a query is ultimately what our work and art boils down to. But what if we've got it all wrong? Web2.0, by many definitions, is about collaborative content creation. Tim Berners-Lee says that Web3.0 is going to be about Linked Data. What if the most important function of the web is really to bring people together around shared goals, dreams, and interests -- and those precious documents are really just so much metadata about people's skills knowledge, and potential? Watch somebody study a field long enough and deep enough, and eventually it seems like it becomes more about the Big Thinkers who have characterized the field than about any individual theory or document. You want to get into their heads; understand what inspires them. If you can, you want to ask them questions and learn from them. Then you build upon it. It's easy to find the Einsteins, the Darwins, the Freuds. Dig a little deeper, and you find the people, themselves giants, who stood on their shoulders. But what if you want to find the person or team who knows the MOST about a very specific type of protein, about building Firefox Plugins, or about adjusting the wheel bearings on a certain kind of vintage motorcycle? This seems to happen to me all the time when I am digging into something for work or play. If you get deep enough, looking for documents doesn't sate your appetite, and you start to look for the masters of the domain -- to see what they're up to; to get into their heads, to ask them questions, or to hire them. We spend an awful lot of time talking about workset merging, deduplication, persistent URLs for works. But maybe we need to spend more time talking about the authors. Maybe at a certain level of research, that humble Author facet becomes what it's all about, and we should all be spending more time worrying about the dismal state of author name normal forms and authorities in the sources we work with. Are there things we should learn about relationships among authors in published works (and mentions of authors in casual websites) that might help guide our users more quickly to the experts, the super-groups, and that one forum where most people are friendly and knowledgeable?

Just Enough Info will Do? Submitted by Steven S (not verified) on Fri, 2011/07/29 - 11:55am. Finding experts is great for intricate details and to discover something totally new, but most people seem to be happy with just enough information to solve a problem or scratch an itch and move on -- the less is more concept. It is easy to be guilty of overthinking a solution to a problem. I'm amazed at the beauty of simplicity of say straight text based websites lacking tons of window dressing but are amazingly fast and easy to use. I love following the 'don't make me think to hard' to process "x" or "y" function for website design. Thus as back end folks the de-dup, merge sets, streamlined but powerful search features help folks accomplish what they want to do: find stuff/information and move on. It seems the best software has a limited number of functions, but all options do distinctly different things. How many times in software do we see 2 option selections that do almost identically the same thing that only a programmer or cataloger would care about? We all have our own interests... Would it be useful to merge wikipedia personality pages of authors to the author birth and death dates on marc records? mmm maybe? For me I would love to have more catalogs search on the certain marc record tags, maybe I'm just old school... It is a Friday :) reply A humanist view regarding questions. Submitted by Brian Kennison (not verified) on Wed, 2011/07/27 - 9:47am. Sebastian, I just read your blog post yesterday and stumbled upon an article in the Chronicle of Higher Education which seemed to be about the same thing. [1] The following is a quote from an article: "... we took a totally new approach to the problem of search. We created what we called a social search engine. When you have a question, we connect you to another person who can give you a live answer. That arose from thinking about the human needs that people have when asking questions. Instead of defining a query as an information-retrieval problem, and returning a list of Web pages, we treat it as an invitation to a human engagement." 1.

<pz:metadata type="fulltext"> Index Data&amp;#039;s DPLA submission | Index Data Search   Software Open Content About us Contact     Home » Index Data&amp;#039;s DPLA submission Submitted by sebastian on Mon, 2011/06/20 - 10:19am Index Data has posted a statement of interest to the DPLA (Digital Public Library of America) beta sprint. We are submitting this together with two academic partners. The proposal in many ways reflects our broader thinking about information architectures and the flow of metadata between organizations, so we thought it would be useful to share it here. Fans of ID may notice that, yes, we are looking at Linked Data too. This will evolve into a detailed proposal between now and September. Users of our tools as well as others who like open discovery technologies are welcome to get in touch if you're interested in discussing this with us. -- This proposal addresses the issue of search and discovery in DPLA – in particular, the integration of many different information sources into one coherent framework that is capable of organic growth as technology, practices, and end-user expectations evolve. Any coherent digital library architecture will depend on an easy flow of metadata between systems: From the simplest ‘catalog’ interface to tools supporting the digitization process, such as collection analysis; prioritizing and scheduling scans, and copyright status analysis. Increasingly, systems can be expected to draw on Linked Data models, since bibliographic data is inherently rich in relations and references that are only poorly represented by current practices. The types of relationships that can be more precisely expressed by Linked Data models include information about authors (How do you know you’re talking about the same author), their creative works, and the various expressions and manifestations of these. Metadata will be used in many scenarios – by end-users as well as the catalogers and curators of the digital library. However, even for end-users, we believe that rather than just a single, public search box, the DPLA must have many faces in many different contexts – from localized library websites to applications for mobile devices and social media sites and applications as yet unthought of. The essence of the individual library is its unique relationship with its local community, so the DPLA architecture must support the notion of many individual organizations each acting independently and participating in its own way, coloring its view of the whole to suit the requirements of its constituents. The best way to meet these requirements is to propose a metadata architecture for the DPLA based on open specifications and open source software to support its initial implementation. Open interfaces and a service-oriented architecture reduce the risk of monolithic software solutions or dependencies on particular computing platforms or development environments: They stimulate an open marketplace of ideas. The architecture will make use of numerous existing technologies, including, SRU, OAI-PMH, and existing and emerging data models such as DublinCore and RDA. The reference implementation will use open source software released both by ourselves and by others. It will include example user interfaces. Index Data specializes in interoperability around metadata through open standards and open source software. We have collaborated with academic organizations, libraries, and government bodies. The partnership behind this proposal has a rich history of research and practical development in the field.

This preconference, facilitated by Ithaka S+R, will explore the growing range of approaches users may take to information discovery in a digital environment and help attendees consider the strategic implications of potential roles that their library could play in supporting their users’ discovery needs. Through a series of panels with library and industry thought leaders, this preconference will explore the following questions: -- How do different approaches to discovery fit into the changing workflows of diverse communities of scholars and students? Are users using the methods that best fit with their workflows and needs, or are they being encouraged to use discovery approaches that don’t match with their objectives? -- How do different approaches to discovery prioritize or hide diverse types of materials, either as a deliberate strategy to lead users to an appropriate set of content or as an unintended side effect of design decisions? -- How do different approaches to discovery reflect different library values and strategies? Are libraries investing in discovery strategies that match well with their broader strategic priorities for supporting their users? Attendees will develop a deeper understanding of the portfolio of discovery solutions available to their constituents and the implications of different choices that their library might make on their users’ ability to effectively find needed materials and on their institution’s broad strategic position.

<pz:metadata type="fulltext"> Blog | Index Data Search   Software Open Content About us Contact     Home » Blog pazpar2: New Features and Challenges by dennis on 2012.03.30 It has been quiet on the pazpar2 front lately, but I will make amends with this blog post. Lately I have been working on a Harvester that would harvest into a Local Unified Index (LUI). The LUI has been implemented with Solr. This means we can implement Integrated Search, which is our name for doing both searching remote targets (meta-searching) and a Local Unified Index (LUI), aka Central Index. New Features With this we saw a need to move the faceting logic from our UI into the backend. The old UI would combine (anding) the user-entered search with the faceting value.

I was a (Code4lib) Newbie, so I didn't really know what to expect, but reading Jakub's blog about his experiences, it sounded like great fun. It was also my first time in Seattle, so I did take some extra days on both ends to do some exploring. Arriving on Saturday to sunny and warm weather (15 degrees Celsius warmer than Copenhagen, nice!), Seattle did its best to welcome me. What if it&amp;#039;s about the People, Stupid? by sebastian on 2011.07.25 Most of the science of Information Retrieval centers around being able to find and rank the right set of documents in response to a given query. We spend much time arguing about technical details like ranking algorithms and the benefits of indexing versus broadcast searching. Every Information Professional I know both deifies and fears Google because they get it right most of the time -- enough so that many people tend to assume that whatever pops to the top of a Google search MUST be right, because it's right there, in the result screen.

We are submitting this together with two academic partners. The proposal in many ways reflects our broader thinking about information architectures and the flow of metadata between organizations, so we thought it would be useful to share it here. Fans of ID may notice that, yes, we are looking at Linked Data too. Index Data’s Integrated Discovery Model by sebastian on 2011.06.13 We are often asked about where we stand on the discussion of central indexing versus broadcast metasearching. Our standard answer: "You probably need some of both" always calls for further explanation. Some time ago, I wrote this up for a potential business partner. If it sounds a little like a marketing spiel... guilty as charged. I hope the content will still seem interesting to some folks thinking about these issues. Code4lib 2011 Report -- Part2 by jakub on 2011.05.24 Code4lib 2011 in Bloomington, IN -- Part2 Good things come to those who wait! Here's the Code4Lib 2011 Report Part 2. I toyed with the idea of postponing it indefinitely and have you checking impatiently the Index Data's blog RSS feed but Higher Powers persuaded me otherwise :). Code4lib 2011 report -- part I by jakub on 2011.03.11 Code4lib 2011 in Bloomington, IN So it took me a while to process all that happened during the conference and come up with a short summary. (1 comments) On preferring open-source software by mike on 2011.01.31 I spent most of last week up in Edinburgh, for the Open Edge conference on open-source software in libraries, attended mostly by academic librarians and their technical people. It was an interesting time, and I met a lot of interesting people. At the risk of overusing the word "interesting", it was also of interest to see how widespread the deployment of "next-generation OPACs" like VuFind and Blacklight has become. (4 comments) Clustering Snippets With Carrot2 by jason on 2010.11.20 We've been investigating ways we might add result clustering to our metasearch tools. Here's a short introduction to the topic and to an open source platform for experimenting in this area. SOLR support in ZOOM, Pazpar2, and MasterKey by dennis on 2010.09.17 We have always held that the schism between broadcast metasearching and local indexing is rather goofy -- that in practice, you do whatever it takes to get the results in front of your user when and where he needs it, and the best solutions will allow for whatever approach is needed in the moment. Inspired by the increasing popularity of the SOLR/Lucene indexing server in the library world, we have just completed a project to add support for SOLR targets in the ZOOM API implementation in the YAZ library. So YAZ now supports Z39.50, SRU/SRW 1.x and the SOLR API.

I was a (Code4lib) Newbie, so I didn't really know what to expect, but reading Jakub's blog about his experiences, it sounded like great fun. It was also my first time in Seattle, so I did take some extra days on both ends to do some exploring. Arriving on Saturday to sunny and warm weather (15 degrees Celsius warmer than Copenhagen, nice!), Seattle did its best to welcome me. Pre-conference I am currently working on our Harvester and Local Unified Index (LUI) products, the latter implemented using Solr, so I was really excited about the half-day pre-conference on new features in Solr. Sadly Eric Hatcher wasn't able to make it this year, but we had a good Q&amp;amp;A session. A lot of wisdom came from Tom Burton-West with his experience with the Hathi Trust Indexing. I have a personal interest in maps, so I went to the GEO session in the afternoon. Mike Graves and Tim Shearer, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill held a very good introduction to Geo APIs and how to do Geo Hashing, e.g. turning two-dimensional coordinates like latitude, longitude into a single number that can easily be indexed and searched. They also had some great demos of the stuff. Slides Conference The conference started with a deeply personal keynote by Dan Chudnov, George Washington University with an introduction about being a cancer survivor, but the theme was really about how code4lib hadn't scaled up to accommodate everyone that wanted to come this year. It was done as a one-on-one talk between a couple with: "We need to have a talk", "I love you (the audience)". Quite funny. There was a lot of very good sessions, but I will limit this to the ones that stuck out the most to me. Jennifer Bowen, University of Rochester, had an interesting talk (Slides, Download) about the road map for Linked Data in XC. On a more "Do linked data now" approach, Jason Ronallo, North Carolina State University, introduced us to HTML5 Microdata format and schemas on schema.org. Slides Tom Burton-West did a great talk about Solr indexing of Haiti Trust, too short when you are interested in the stuff, but his slides are available here (download). The (other) Danes, Jørn Thøgersen and Michael Poltorak, Statsbibliotek / State and University LIbrary, Århus, held the presentation "Kill the Search button II" about alternatives way of navigating in a mobile application (tilting, rotating). I think we are going to look a little funny when we start using our whole body for interacting with our mobile devices ;-) In the "Design for Developers" (Download) by Lisa Kurt, University of Nevada, we developers got some advice about doing good design (do not use a "Rainbow shitstorm" of colors and other funny expressions, I sadly didn't get down). If the video gets up on the code4lib site, I would recommend watching it before "throwing" together some UI. On Newbies Dinner Tuesday, I had a great evening with Tim Shearer (UNC, Chapel Hill), Andrew Nagy (Serial Solutions), Cory Low (NCSU Libraries) and Tim Clarke (Muhlenberg College-Trexler Libraries) at a nice Japanese restaurant Momiji. Wednesday started out with "Discovering Digital Library User Behavior with Google Analytics" by Kirk Hess, University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (download) and ["How People Search the Library from a single search box" by Cory Low]( both on what can discovered about user behaviors from statistics. Stack View was a neat graphical way of showing search results, displaying as books with different colors and sizes depending on page count and on popularity. "In-browser date storages" (Download) by Jason Casden, North Carolina State University was a great summary about Web storage APIs, if you are going to handle off-line results. But as with most browser techniques the "Only One" cannot be called out yet. The Wednesday evening event was the "Bring Your Local Beer". I sadly hadn't packed any Danish microbrews. Mikkeller Beer Geek Brunch Weasel would have been perfect for this occasion. But I donated some Pike Brewery beers, and a growler of Hofbraü München beer from Tap House Grill (160 beers on tap). Multiple rooms were "in play", some warnings about noise were given, but no rooms had to close down. It was a great evening. Don't really recall my bedtime. I think this could be the cause Thursday started with a keynote from Bethany Nowviskie about "Lazy Consensus" or how to manage/live with Committee (Design) decisions at big institutions, followed by an interesting talk about combining standard relevance ranking with static ranking by Mike Schultz Download. Lightning talks The lightning talks sign-up started when the conference began. I picked a Thursday spot within the first half hour, which was good because it was sold out pretty quick, and I didn't have a presentation yet. In retrospect I should have picked Wednesday, so I could have had the chance to talk with people about it. (And also not following the "Bring Your Local beer" evening.) Most interesting/funny: Andrew Nagy, Serial Solutions: "Vendors suck". Why vendor doesn't always suck, introducing him now on the other side as new Product Manager at Serial Solutions. akorphan - Heat maps... not just for input analysis Eric Larson -- Finding images in book page images PDF. Kåre Fiedler Christiansen (@kaarefc) -- Chucking all the software components in a library together to present recorded radio and TV. Funny illustrated with Lego persons. PDF And my own: Turbo MARC in YAZ: I was afraid of running out of time but ended too soon. I should have used the last minutes for questions. Wasn't good enough to catch this and use the time. But the word on TurboMARC has been spread. Naomi Dushay, Standford U. has emailed about doing a Ruby Gem. Last evening at the bar I talked with David Bucknum, LoC, and he would mention this to his colleague working on this. YAZ (and Index Data) got some good karma on the IRC channel. It was a really great experience, learning a lot of new stuff, meeting up with grateful users/customers, getting good street cred by other vendors/developers, but I really maxed out with information from talks and flooding of messages from the IRC channel. Some kind of memory expansion plugin for my brain would be nice ;-). As a side note, I mentioned in the talk, I have done some work on creating a similar TurboMARC writer in Java. Based on MARC4J by Bas Peters, I have added a TurboMarcXmlWriter. I haven't seen the same 4-fold improvement here, but I am looking into this. Until it has been integrated upstream, the source can be found at git://git.indexdata.com/marc4j. In the beginning, I did feel a little like a stranger as vendor along with all those Universities, but now after it: "I'd love to see you all again". cheers, :-Dennis Add new comment     News Index Data Introduces Connectors in the Cloud Posted on 2013.01.09 Visit Index Data at ALA Midwinter in Seattle!
