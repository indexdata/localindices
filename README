--- COMPILING

Compilation works easiest with netbeans (http://www.netbeans.org), though ant can be used as well. In netbeans go to File > Project Group... > New Group.. and select _Folder of projects_ then browse to the main git project directory (_localindices_). All projects should be loaded and you'll probably see import conflicts and data source problems.

--- Deps

TODO

If you have an javaee.jar import problem fix it by pointing to the file in the glassfish/lib directory.

--- RUNNING

Make sure you have mysql installed, configured and running. Then create an empty database and user (using mysql console):

    create database localidxadm;
    grant all privileges on localidxadm.* to 'localidxadm'@'localhost' 
                identified by 'localidxadmpass';

In netbeans, select localindices-harvester as the main project and press F6 (this step is required because only this project have a DataSource definition required in glassfish and has to be loaded first). Harvester should start up and load DB schema. It should be also possible to deploy the admin now. For admin configuration (like WS URL) look in the web.xml.
